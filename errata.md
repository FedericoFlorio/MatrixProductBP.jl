# Errata for "Matrix Product Belief Propagation for reweighted stochastic dynamics over graphs"
Stefano Crotti, Alfredo Braunstein

The article is found at https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2307935120, the supplementary information at https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2307935120#supplementary-materials.

1. At page 5, below equation 12, the text says $p(m)$ has a minimum at $m\approx 0.145$. It should be either $p(m)$ has a maximum at $m\approx 0.145$ or $g(m)$ has a minimum  at $m\approx 0.145$.
2. In section 1 of the supplementary information, on pages 2-3, equations S1, S2, S3, S5, and S7 have a minus sign after $\exp\left \\{ \right .$, which should not be there.
3. In section 2 of the supplementary information, on page 3, equation S8 says $f_i^1(x_i^1|\boldsymbol{x}^0_{\partial i}, x_i^0)$ when it should be $f_i^1(x_i^1,\boldsymbol{x}_{\partial i}^0, x_i^0)$, without conditioning.
